"""Day 7, part 2.

The crabs don't seem interested in your proposed solution.
Perhaps you misunderstand crab engineering?

As it turns out, crab submarine engines don't burn fuel at
a constant rate. Instead, each change of 1 step in horizontal
position costs 1 more unit of fuel than the last: the first
step costs 1, the second step costs 2, the third step costs
3, and so on.

As each crab moves, moving further becomes more expensive.
This changes the best horizontal position to align them
all on; in the example above, this becomes 5:

    Move from 16 to 5: 66 fuel
    Move from 1 to 5: 10 fuel
    Move from 2 to 5: 6 fuel
    Move from 0 to 5: 15 fuel
    Move from 4 to 5: 1 fuel
    Move from 2 to 5: 6 fuel
    Move from 7 to 5: 3 fuel
    Move from 1 to 5: 10 fuel
    Move from 2 to 5: 6 fuel
    Move from 14 to 5: 45 fuel

This costs a total of 168 fuel. This is the new cheapest
possible outcome; the old alignment position (2) now costs
206 fuel instead.

Determine the horizontal position that the crabs can align
to using the least fuel possible so they can make you an
escape route! How much fuel must they spend to align to
that position?
