> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming
puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that
can be solved in any programming language you like. People
use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company
training, university coursework, practice problems,
or to challenge each other.

are solved both in a pure python version and a version
using numpy.
